This is the static generator for [Late night snack], a collection of
listings explicitly made for reading, that tries to replicate the
feeling of reading programs from computer magazines in the eighties.

Articles are generated from the original source listings, in a manner
that is not dissimilar to [docco]. The code is ordered to follow the
narrative, rather than the other way around, and so, it is a form of
literate programming.

The generator itself is made to be simple and easy to read. I am
planning to experiment with this format, and I want something that can
grow with me.

I hope you enjoy it.
