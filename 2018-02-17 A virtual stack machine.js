/**
 * A virtual stack machine
 * =======================
 * 17 February 2018 â€” https://latenightsnack.io
 *
 * A [virtual machine] is a simulated computer. Computers are highly
 * predictable machines, whose behavior only depend on their program,
 * inputs, and previous [state]. If we have knowledge of all those
 * elements, we can reproduce the machine in software entirely.
 *
 * Specifically, this is a [stack machine], which gets its name from
 * the [stack] it uses as its main data structure. A stack is a pile
 * of values, where entries get placed and taken from the top. Most
 * operations *pop* one or two operands from the top of the stack, and
 * *push* back the results.
 *
 * This is not an emulator of a real machine, but an *ideal* machine,
 * with infinite memory and few limitations on data size, where all
 * instructions execute in one cycle, and there is no need to respect
 * tight timings or synchronize with other devices. This is only
 * possible because it runs on a high-level run-time (the javascript
 * engine) which abstract all of these problems away from us.
 *
 * I designed this machine to be nimble, readable, yet expressive and
 * fun to play with.

/**
 * Let's start with a program
 * --------------------------
 * This is a short program that computes ten iterations of the
 * [fibonacci sequence].
 *
 * A program is a contiguous sequence of numbers, called [opcodes],
 * each one representing a different [instruction], optionally
 * followed by their data. Together, they are referred to as the
 * [machine code]. Execution starts from the first instruction, and
 * continues until the end of the program is reached.
 *
 * Our program memory is represented as [read-only memory], a type of
 * memory that cannot be written back. It is the only external input
 * our machines has. Program memory is separate from [application
 * memory], a configuration known as [Harvard architecture], and
 * machine code cannot access it. Among other things, this means that
 * a program cannot [modify itself], or provide additional code for
 * execution.
 *
 * The most astute among you might notice that this program could be
 * much shorter, while retaining the same functionality. Try and see
 * how much you can [optimize] it.

 * One seemingly-useless operation, `NOP`, does exactly nothing. It is

 * Where to go from here
 * =====================
 * I only included these 24 instructions, to keep the overall design
 * simple, yet useful, and not too distracting from the core concept
 * of a programmable machine. However, you can invent new instructions
 * to do all sort of useful and interesting things, like squaring
 * numbers, generating [random values], breaking into a [debugger], or
 * accessing virtual [peripherals].
 *
 * Speaking of which, you might have noticed that this machine has no
 * way to communicate with the external world. If you ask, I am sure
 * that it is dying to [interact with humans] or [other machines]. Why
 * not provide a few instructions to read [input] from the [keyboard],
 * or a [game controller]?
 *
 * [human interaction]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction
 *
 * You might want to support text as well. But how do you represent
 * text, when you only have numbers at your disposal? You use a [text
 * encoding], for example, the famous [ASCII encoding], which maps
 * numbers from `0` to `127` to characters from the latin alphabet,
 * and vice-versa.
 *
 * At this point, why not add full [video] and [audio] capabilities?
 * Some machines provide special instructions to operate their
 * hardware, such as `LINE`, `COLOR`, `SOUND`, and our own `OUT`
 * instruction. Other machines allow their programmers to directly
 * control what appears on the screen by writing to [video memory],
 * which is [memory-mapped] to a specific memory region, so that
 * writing a `97` at location `42` might make an `a` character appear
 * at row `3`, column `2`, turn on a red pixel, or maybe play a
 * musical note.
 *
 * You could [embed] this [virtual machine] as part of some other
 * program, why not? For example, you could use it to [control] a [3d
 * printer], or an [IOT sensor]. You could even use one to script your
 * game, just like the legendary [ScummVM] did.
 *
 * Finally, you can turn towards emulating real machines. The [IBM
 * Model 25] mainframe played a very nice trick: it could load its
 * microcode from [punched card], therefore being able to emulate
 * other machines, and becoming compatible with code written for them.
 * Or you could go deeper, and add details from physical machines:
 * limited memory capacity, fixed-sized data types, complex timings,
 * interrupts, and so on.
 *
 * Have a good night.
