                        <p>17 February 2018 â€” <a href="https://latenightsnack.io">https://latenightsnack.io</a></p>
                        <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> is a simulated computer. Computers are highly predictable machines, whose behavior only depend on their program, inputs, and previous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science)">state</a>.
                            If we have knowledge of all those elements, we can reproduce the machine in software entirely.</p>
                        <p>Specifically, this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine">stack machine</a>, which gets its name from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a> it uses as its main data
                            structure. A stack is a pile of values, where entries get placed and taken from the top. Most operations <em>pop</em> one or two operands from the top of the stack, and <em>push</em> back the results.</p>
                        <p>This is not an emulator of a real machine, but an <em>ideal</em> machine, with infinite memory and few limitations on data size, where all instructions execute in one cycle, and there is no need to respect tight timings or synchronize
                            with other devices. This is only possible because it runs on a high-level run-time (the javascript engine) which abstract all of these problems away from us.</p>
                        <p>I designed this machine to be nimble, readable, yet expressive and fun to play with.</p>

                        <p>This is a short program that computes ten iterations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">fibonacci sequence</a>.</p>
                        <p>A program is a contiguous sequence of numbers, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode">opcodes</a>, each one representing a different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction</a>,
                            optionally followed by their data. Together, they are referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a>. Execution starts from the first instruction, and continues until the end of the
                            program is reached.</p>
                        <p>Our program memory is represented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-only_memory">read-only memory</a>, a type of memory that cannot be written back. It is the only external input our machines has. Program memory is
                            separate from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">application
memory</a>, a configuration known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture">Harvard architecture</a>, and machine code cannot access it. Among other things, this means that a program cannot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code">modify itself</a>,
                            or provide additional code for execution.</p>
                        <p>The most astute among you might notice that this program could be much shorter, while retaining the same functionality. Try and see how much you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization">optimize</a> it.</p>

                        <p>A machine is commonly defined by its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction set</a>. The amount, flexibility, and expressiveness of the instructions provided by the machine will make a

                        <p>Can there be an architecture other than instruction set? Of course! For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_instruction_set_computer">zero-instruction set computer</a> can be said to have no instructions at

                        <p>I only included these 24 instructions, to keep the overall design simple, yet useful, and not too distracting from the core concept of a programmable machine. However, you can invent new instructions to do all sort of useful and
                            interesting things, like squaring numbers, generating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random values</a>, breaking into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger</a>, or accessing
                            virtual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral">peripherals</a>.</p>
                        <p>Speaking of which, you might have noticed that this machine has no way to communicate with the external world. If you ask, I am sure that it is dying to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanâ€“computer_interaction">interact with humans</a>                            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine">other machines</a>. Why not provide a few instructions to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_(computer_science)">input</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboard">keyboard</a>,
                            or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_controller">game controller</a>?</p>
                        <p>You might want to support text as well. But how do you represent text, when you only have numbers at your disposal? You use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding">text
encoding</a>, for example, the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII encoding</a>, which maps numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>127</code> to characters from the latin alphabet, and vice-versa.</p>
                        <p>At this point, why not add full <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device">video</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio">audio</a> capabilities? Some machines provide special instructions to operate
                            their hardware, such as <code>LINE</code>, <code>COLOR</code>, <code>SOUND</code>, and our own <code>OUT</code> instruction. Other machines allow their programmers to directly control what appears on the screen by writing to
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_display_controller">video memory</a>, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O">memory-mapped</a> to a specific memory region, so that writing a <code>97</code>                            at location <code>42</code> might make an <code>a</code> character appear at row <code>3</code>, column <code>2</code>, turn on a red pixel, or maybe play a musical note.</p>
                        <p>You could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system">embed</a> this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> as part of some other program, why not? For example, you could use it
                            to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controller_(computing)">control</a> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing">3d
printer</a>, or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things">IOT sensor</a>. You could even use one to script your game, just like the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScummVM">ScummVM</a> did.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you can turn towards emulating real machines. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360_Model_25">IBM
Model 25</a> mainframe played a very nice trick: it could load its microcode from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punched_card">punched card</a>, therefore being able to emulate other machines, and becoming compatible with code written for them.
                            Or you could go deeper, and add details from physical machines: limited memory capacity, fixed-sized data types, complex timings, interrupts, and so on.</p>
